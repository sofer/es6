# ES6

ECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) is the future and it has arrived. It promises to make JavaScript code easier to both read and write. The two downsides right now (other than having to learn some new vocabulary, syntax and idioms) are that 1) not all browsers support ES2015, so for production  code you will need to transpile your client-side JavaScript back to ES5; and 2) most code out there is written in ES5, so you might have to think a bit harder about any code snippets you find on Google and reuse for your own purposes (some might see that as an advantage).

There are a lot of changes, some highly significant, some less so. To get a very opinionated overview, watch Douglas Crockford's [*Better Parts* talk](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4). Then, just dive in.

Start by trying an interactive session ES6 on [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/traceur), using Ralph Engelschall's fantastic [comparison of ES5 and ES6 idioms](http://es6-features.org/).

To get started on Chrome, Enable Experimental JavaScript (chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony) to access ES6 via the console.

Keep track of browser compatibility using [ECMAScript compatibility table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

For production code, download and use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to translate your ES2015 code to ES5.

The [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) has recently been updated for ES6 and is a great place to get a quick overview of best practices.
