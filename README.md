# ES2015

ES2015 (or ES6) is the future and it has arrived. It promises to make JavaScript code easier to both read and write. The two downsides right now are that 1) not all browsers support ES2015, so you will have to transpile your client-side JavaScript back to ES5; and 2) most code out there is written in ES5, so you might have to think a bit harder about any code snippets you find on google and reuse for your own purposes (some might see that as an advantage).

Download and use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to translate your ES2015 code to ES5.

As a starting point, follow the guidance of the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), which has recently been updated for ES2015.

On Chrome, [Enable Experimental JavaScript](chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony) (chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony) to access ES2015 via the console.

Keep track of browser compality using [ECMAScript compatibility table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).
